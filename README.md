- Users can revisit the desired website easier or restore any previous session and visit the desired webpage from that session. 

- Willow also provides a tool to crawl a particular URL and find all webpages underneath the given page. After the crawling has finished the node will display the number of broken links in its page(if any). This should be especially useful for web site developers.
